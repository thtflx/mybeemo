Mother monkey rushed into Monty’s room to check what had happened. When she entered the room, she was shocked. Monty’s face started developing bumps!</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-6">“Mum, these bumps are so itchy!” Monty wailed as he scratched all over his face. “Don’t touch your face, Monty! Let me bring you to the doctor now!” Mother said anxiously.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-7">Quickly, Monty and his mother rushed to the clinic. After some time, it was finally Monty’s turn to see the doctor. The doctor looked at the bumps and asked a few questions, “Did you have a headache and a fever?”</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-8">Monty replied, “Yes.”</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-9">“Did you feel some muscle aches and feeling of tiredness?” the doctor continued.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-10">Monty said, “Yes.”</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-11">Next, the doctor examines the bumps on his face and body.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-12">“I think you might have monkeypox.” The doctor said as he took samples of the fluid from the bumps.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-13">Mother monkey was shocked. “What is that? Is there any cure?”</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-14">“Well, Monkeypox is caused by a virus. It has been around since the 1950s. It occurs primarily in tropical rainforest areas of central and west Africa and is occasionally exported to other regions. Although it resembles smallpox, it is much less contagious. Unfortunately, as of now, there are still no cures, but vaccines are being developed.” The doctor explained.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-15">“But doctor, how do they spread? I don’t want my family to get it.” Monty asked sadly.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-16">“It can spread through close contact, air droplets from breath, body fluids from the infected person or even contaminated materials such as beddings from the infected.”</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-17">“Mum, please stay away from me. I do not wish to infect you.” Monty sulked.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-18">“Yes, it will be great if your mother can wash her hands frequently, especially when she is in contact with you, and also wear a mask!” the doctor advised.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-19">“Please do so, mum. I don’t want you to have ugly face with rashes like me.” Monty looked at his mum sadly.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-20">His mother let out a tiny smile, not knowing if she should laugh or cry.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="mnk-text-21">The end.</p>

                        <div class="n-context">
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-1">A mischievous tiger named Tyga bullied other animals as he appeared massive and more ferocious than others. Whenever he sees other smaller animals, he either makes fun of them or pushes them. Everyone avoided him because they were terrified of him.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-2">One day, Tyga was alone in the woods, feeling bored. After walking around aimlessly, he got drowsy and napped under a nearby tree. While in his sleepy state, Tyga suddenly felt an itchy sensation. At first, he merely scratched lightly. However, the itch became more intense, and he began scratching. Tyga could not bear the sudden severe itch that he sat up and scratched hard.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-3">“What exactly is it on my body? Get off of me!” Tyga roared. A little bug crept up to the tiger’s whiskers, waved at him, and said, “Hello, my name is Buggy.” Tyga twitched his whiskers in an attempt to expel Buggy from his face. However, Buggy dodged it and jumped off to the top of his head. “You tiny little thing. Stay away from me! How dare you challenge me when you are just a small little creature? I’m going to smack you flat!” Tyga yelled.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-4">Tyga lowered his head and used his paws to brush Buggy off his head unsuccessfully. Buggy quickly hopped to his back. Tyga tried again to use his claws to reach his back but could not get Buggy. This went on for some time until, eventually, Tyga was exhausted.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-5">“What do you want before you leave me alone?” Tyga asked in frustration. “This is my territory now,” the bug murmured as he emerged from his hiding place.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-6">“What exactly do you mean by “your territory”? You are on MY body.” Tyga said. “I’ll be staying here. You can’t drive me away.” Buggy replied.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-7">This infuriated Tyga and made him determined to get rid of Buggy.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-8">Tyga started shaking his body vigorously to shake off the bug. He began very gently and progressed to a more erratic shaking. After a while, Tyga became dizzy from all the swinging. He came to a halt, believing he had exterminated Buggy. To his surprise, he felt that tingly sensation again. “I’m still here,” Buggy joked.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-9">Tyga then began striking Buggy with his hands and tail all around his body. The more he whipped his body, the more unbearable he felt. “Ouch! My entire body is in excruciating pain.” He yelled. The cheeky Buggy got close to his ears and started chuckling at him.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-10">The enraged Tyga then lay down on the ground and began rolling around, attempting to move over Buggy. However, as he rolled around, he did not notice a sharp branch nearby, which poked him hard. He screamed in agony.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-11">This time, Buggy proceeded to bite him in the ears. Tyga wailed louder. “Please stop.” He pleaded as he was in so much pain. “From now on, you must stop scaring and bullying the other animals,” the bug said. “If not, I’ll return and hide under your furs forever. Do you hear me?” Buggy said.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-12">“I will, of course. I’m not going to hurt the other animals again.” Tyga responded. With that, Buggy flew away.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-13">Since that day, Tyga remembered Buggy’s words and did not disturb the other animals again.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="tigbug-text-14">The end.</p>

                        <div class="n-context">
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-1">Far far away, in the deepest forest was a small cottage. There lived a moon witch named, Monica.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-2">Do you know why she’s called a Moon Witch? That’s because she only opens her business on nights when there is a full moon. The people who know her called her by that name.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-3">The Moon Witch’s shop is packed with many interesting ancient stones, animal carcasses, and potions of all sorts. However, the most unique thing about the moon witch is her origami. Every piece of paper she folded, come alive
                                with her magic. The moon witch absolutely love folding flowers, boats and insects during her leisure time. Soon, the whole house was filled with origami art.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-4">“Oh dear, there are no more space in my tiny house. I need some help to clear up!” The moon witch thought in dismay.
                                <br>She began folding some paper to make into little helpers.
                            </p>
                            <!-- <img class="n-context-img" src="img/histories/nc1-1.jpg"> -->
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-5">However, the messy moon witch can be a little careless. She accidentally dropped one of them near her magic potion which was not sealed properly in the glass jar.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-6">The magic aura senses the magical papers and drifted towards the folded paper boy. After a while, the tiny paper boy sat up. It looked around to check out the surroundings curiously.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-7">“There’s no one here. Looks like I’m going to have some fun!” the paper boy grinned. Quickly, he ran to the table and saw some cookies. He took a bite, and another bite, causing the crumps to fall all over the table. When he
                                heard some noise coming, he hastily got up, slid down the rocking chair and landed on the ground. He yelled out in ecstasy, “I am going out to explore the world!”</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-8">Stealthily, he slides himself through the gap of the door and out on his adventure.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-9">As he continued his journey, he came across a village. At this point, he was already famished. The paper boy saw a candy house nearby and decided to pop into the shop. There were a wide variety of candies, lollipops and chocolates.
                                He gobbled one after another and did not notice that the shopkeeper saw him.</p>
                            <!-- <img class="n-context-img" src="img/histories/nc1-2.jpg"> -->
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-10">“Thief!” The shopkeeper shouted and chased after the paper boy. “Uh-oh.” Once the paper boy realized he was caught, he proceeded to the window and took off. At that very moment, there was a gust of wind so powerful that it
                                blew, and he was able to flee the area by flying with the wind. “Phew, that was close! I am such an adventurer! He reflected on it with a sense of superiority.</p>
                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-11">Happy that things were going smooth for him, the paper boy got more daring. He felt bored and thought of playing a game. He picked up stones on the ground and started to target passer-by who walk past and throw it at them.
                                He would then immediately lie down so that no one could tell where the stone was coming from or who was responsible for throwing it. He was successful in injuring a handful of them, and nobody was sure where the stone had
                                come from.</p> -->
                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-12">Just then, someone who happened to pass by in the other direction noticed the paper boy and realised what he was doing. The villager shouted, “The culprit is here!”</p> -->
                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-13">“Oops.” The paper boy ran as soon as he was aware someone found him. Everyone began to pursue him after they saw him run. Just nice, a bird was about to fly off as it was startled by the huge crowd. The paper boy clings on
                                to the bird’s feet and flew away. When he gazed down at the angry crowd below, he couldn’t help but crack a grin.</p> -->
                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-14">Soon, words spread about the strange paper boy that has been causing trouble. Very quickly, the moon witch became aware of the paper boy’s existence.</p> -->
                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-15">“Oh dear, it must be one of my boys who escaped! I must find him!” she bellowed.
                                <br>With her enchanted broom, she took flight in search of her paper boy.
                                <br>As she flew across the sky, she folded some crows with her magic origami papers to help her track down the paper boy.
                                <br>After a long search, the magic crows suddenly made their target on a particular spot and went right at it at full speed. The moon witch knew at that moment that the crows had spotted the paper boy.
                            </p> -->
                            <!-- <img class="n-context-img" src="img/histories/nc1-3.jpg"> -->
                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-16">When the paper boy heard the sound of the crows, he knew with his magic sense that they are coming for him. Quickly, he sped off in the fastest possible direction.

                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-17">The crows noticed him and flew towards him, where they attempted to bring him back by pecking at him. There were those who attempted to grab him with their feet. Others made attempts to pin him down.</p> -->
                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-18">After some struggle, the paper boy was so worn out that he collapsed on the ground. Crows started to close in on him to prevent him from escaping.</p> -->
                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-19">The moon witch slowly walked towards him. When she came close, the crows shifted their positions to make room for her. She rebuked him and said, “You mischievous one. How dare you escape to cause trouble to everyone. Now you
                                shall return with me and receive your punishment.”</p> -->
                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-20">Once the moon witch finished speaking, the crow picked the paper boy up with its feet and flew back to the the moon witch’s house in the mountains.</p> -->

                                with the moon witch!</p> -->

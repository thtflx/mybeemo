                            <p class="n-context-text">It was a warm afternoon. Mouse and rabbit were feeling a little bored from basking under the sun. Mouse came up with an idea, “Let’s go and explore the woods beyond.”</p>
                            <img class="n-context-img" src="img/histories/stock.png">
                            <p class="n-context-text">Rabbit hesitated and said, “That does sound fun. However, my mother told me dangers were lurking deeper in the woods.” Mouse assured her, “Don’t worry, we will not go too deep in. And we will be careful.” They both agreed and
                                decided to pack some food in their lunch box before heading out.</p>
                            <img class="n-context-img" src="img/histories/stock.png">
                            <p class="n-context-text">Once they got their lunch box ready, they started to venture into the direction of the woods. It was a beautiful afternoon with bright sunlight. The forest woods was bustling with activities. The mouse and rabbit enjoyed the
                                charming sight of the colourful flowers, the relaxing sound of flowing waters, and the music from the screeches of the bugs.</p>
                            <img class="n-context-img" src="img/histories/stock.png">
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb">It was such a pleasant experience that they did not note how deep they had gone into the woods. Soon, they realize that the bustling sound slowly became softer. The sun lights that shone through to the forest floor became dimmer.
                                <br>Feeling uneasy, the rabbit said, “Mouse, we seem to be going too deep into the forest. I am a little scared now.” Mouse replied, “Don’t worry, rabbit, we will be fine. Let’s explore further.”
                                <br>The rabbit was reluctant but was afraid to go back alone. “Wait for me!” she called out to mouse before running forward to join him. After some time, they heard a loud strange noise coming from the path in front of
                                them. Rabbit took a few steps back and whispered, “Mouse, we should leave now. There must be a monster in front.”
                                <br>Being adventurous, the mouse said, “Or maybe it’s the sound from a giant. Let’s go check it out. Just be quiet and very careful.” Both of them approach the direction of the sound, and it led them to a wooden hut. The
                                wooden hut looked old and abandoned. The roof was a little tattered, and the house seemed to be swaying from side to side from the vibration of the loud strange noise.
                                <br>“Ah! It’s a haunted wooden hut. There is such a thing in a fairy tale book.” The little mouse muttered. Rabbit nervously pulled the mouse from advancing forward. She said, “Don’t go in there, mouse! Maybe a monster
                                is in there. It could hurt us!”
                                <br>The curious mouse was so engrossed with investigating who was making this noise that he did not hear the rabbit. He continued towards the house and peeked through the window. Rabbit hurriedly followed. As the window
                                was too dusty, they could not see clearly. The mouse went on to open the door gently. The door creaked a little and opened. Both of them tiptoed inside.
                                <br>They followed the direction of the noise and saw a massive creature on the ground. Rabbit almost screamed but covered her mouth. She gasped and said, “Let’s go, mouse!” Instead of doing so, the mouse went nearer to
                                the giant creature to see its appearance.
                            </p>
                            <p class="n-context-text">He started to giggled a little when he saw what it was. The mouse turned to the rabbit and said, “It’s Piggy!” Piggy was sleeping on the bed with its mouth open. When he breathes in the air, it makes a loud sound. This is the
                                mystery of the loud strange noise!</p>

                        <div class="n-context">
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-1">Far far away, in the deepest forest was a small cottage. There lived a moon witch named, Monica.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-2">Do you know why she’s called a Moon Witch? That’s because she only opens her business on nights when there is a full moon. The people who know her called her by that name.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-3">The Moon Witch’s shop is packed with many interesting ancient stones, animal carcasses, and potions of all sorts. However, the most unique thing about the moon witch is her origami. Every piece of paper she folded, come alive
                                with her magic. The moon witch absolutely love folding flowers, boats and insects during her leisure time. Soon, the whole house was filled with origami art.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-4">“Oh dear, there are no more space in my tiny house. I need some help to clear up!” The moon witch thought in dismay.
                                <br>She began folding some paper to make into little helpers.
                            </p>
                            <img class="n-context-img" src="img/histories/nc1-1.jpg">
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-5">However, the messy moon witch can be a little careless. She accidentally dropped one of them near her magic potion which was not sealed properly in the glass jar.</p>
                            <!-- <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-6">The magic aura senses the magical papers and drifted towards the folded paper boy. After a while, the tiny paper boy sat up. It looked around to check out the surroundings curiously.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-7">“There’s no one here. Looks like I’m going to have some fun!” the paper boy grinned. Quickly, he ran to the table and saw some cookies. He took a bite, and another bite, causing the crumps to fall all over the table. When he
                                heard some noise coming, he hastily got up, slid down the rocking chair and landed on the ground. He yelled out in ecstasy, “I am going out to explore the world!”</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-8">Stealthily, he slides himself through the gap of the door and out on his adventure.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-9">As he continued his journey, he came across a village. At this point, he was already famished. The paper boy saw a candy house nearby and decided to pop into the shop. There were a wide variety of candies, lollipops and chocolates.
                                He gobbled one after another and did not notice that the shopkeeper saw him.</p>
                            <img class="n-context-img" src="img/histories/nc1-2.jpg">
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-10">“Thief!” The shopkeeper shouted and chased after the paper boy. “Uh-oh.” Once the paper boy realized he was caught, he proceeded to the window and took off. At that very moment, there was a gust of wind so powerful that it
                                blew, and he was able to flee the area by flying with the wind. “Phew, that was close! I am such an adventurer! He reflected on it with a sense of superiority.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-11">Happy that things were going smooth for him, the paper boy got more daring. He felt bored and thought of playing a game. He picked up stones on the ground and started to target passer-by who walk past and throw it at them.
                                He would then immediately lie down so that no one could tell where the stone was coming from or who was responsible for throwing it. He was successful in injuring a handful of them, and nobody was sure where the stone had
                                come from.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-12">Just then, someone who happened to pass by in the other direction noticed the paper boy and realised what he was doing. The villager shouted, “The culprit is here!”</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-13">“Oops.” The paper boy ran as soon as he was aware someone found him. Everyone began to pursue him after they saw him run. Just nice, a bird was about to fly off as it was startled by the huge crowd. The paper boy clings on
                                to the bird’s feet and flew away. When he gazed down at the angry crowd below, he couldn’t help but crack a grin.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-14">Soon, words spread about the strange paper boy that has been causing trouble. Very quickly, the moon witch became aware of the paper boy’s existence.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-15">“Oh dear, it must be one of my boys who escaped! I must find him!” she bellowed.
                                <br>With her enchanted broom, she took flight in search of her paper boy.
                                <br>As she flew across the sky, she folded some crows with her magic origami papers to help her track down the paper boy.
                                <br>After a long search, the magic crows suddenly made their target on a particular spot and went right at it at full speed. The moon witch knew at that moment that the crows had spotted the paper boy.
                            </p>
                            <img class="n-context-img" src="img/histories/nc1-3.jpg">
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-16">When the paper boy heard the sound of the crows, he knew with his magic sense that they are coming for him. Quickly, he sped off in the fastest possible direction.
                            </p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-17">The crows noticed him and flew towards him, where they attempted to bring him back by pecking at him. There were those who attempted to grab him with their feet. Others made attempts to pin him down.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-18">After some struggle, the paper boy was so worn out that he collapsed on the ground. Crows started to close in on him to prevent him from escaping.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-19">The moon witch slowly walked towards him. When she came close, the crows shifted their positions to make room for her. She rebuked him and said, “You mischievous one. How dare you escape to cause trouble to everyone. Now you
                                shall return with me and receive your punishment.”</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-20">Once the moon witch finished speaking, the crow picked the paper boy up with its feet and flew back to the the moon witch’s house in the mountains.</p>
                            <p class="n-context-text marg-tb" id="origamib-text-21">Since that day, the paper boy was kept in the house to clean while the crows eye him vigilantly to prevent him from creating more troubles. In fact, he became such a diligent helper in the house and became a great companion
                                with the moon witch!</p>
